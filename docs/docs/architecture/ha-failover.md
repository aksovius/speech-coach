# 🔐 High Availability & Failover Strategy

This section outlines how **Speech Coach** is built with reliability and resilience in mind — and what's planned for future improvements.

---

## 🧱 What Does HA Mean Here?

To me, an HA-ready version of Speech Coach starts with:

- At least **two machines** per role (API, DB, worker)
- **Redis clustering** (2–3 nodes)
- **PostgreSQL HA** using **Patroni + etcd**
- **MinIO + S3 replication** for voice backups
- **HAProxy** for routing across FastAPI nodes and DB leader

I plan to run **load tests** to find real bottlenecks before scaling blindly.

---

## 💥 What Failure Scenarios Worry Me?

The most critical points are:

- **PostgreSQL** – user data
- **MinIO** – audio files (non-recoverable if lost)

These would be my top priorities for redundancy and backups.

---

## 🔄 Planned Failover Strategy

If OpenAI API becomes a bottleneck or goes down, I plan to add **fallback providers** (e.g., Claude, Gemini, local models). That would ensure:

- Lower risk of downtime
- Graceful degradation

---

## 📊 Monitoring and SLA Readiness

If I had to hit **99.9% SLA**, I'd start with:

- Full **monitoring stack** (Grafana + Prometheus + Loki)
- Alerting that "shocks" the devs every time something breaks 🫨
- Health checks, auto-restart, and eventually Kubernetes

## 🌍 Cloud Zones?

Currently running on a single VPS — but the architecture is **multi-zone ready**.
