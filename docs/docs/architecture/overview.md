# ðŸ§  System Overview

Speech Coach is built with a modular microservices architecture designed for real-time audio processing, AI feedback, and language analytics.

The system is divided into logical layers:

- **User & Frontend** â€“ Interaction through Telegram, routed via NGINX
- **Application Layer** â€“ FastAPI + Redis Stream for async task distribution
- **Processing Layer** â€“ Workers handle transcription and feedback via OpenAI
- **Storage Layer** â€“ PostgreSQL for data, MinIO for audio
- **Analytics Layer** â€“ CDC via Debezium â†’ Redpanda â†’ Bytewax for streaming
- **Monitoring & Visualization (Planned)** â€“ Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, ClickHouse

This architecture supports future scaling via FastAPI/Worker clusters, HA PostgreSQL, and a frontend dashboard.
