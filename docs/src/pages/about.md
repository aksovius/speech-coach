## ðŸ§  About Speech Coach

**Speech Coach** is a Telegram-based assistant that helps users practice spoken English through voice messages. Built with AI-powered feedback, speech recognition, and real-time tracking, itâ€™s ideal for TOEFL prep, job interviews, or everyday speaking improvement.

### ðŸš€ Why It Was Built

Originally developed by [Alexander Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aksovius) as a personal tool for TOEFL and interview practice, Speech Coach quickly grew into a full-fledged portfolio project. It demonstrates experience in backend architecture, data streaming, and AI integration.

### ðŸŽ¯ Vision

More than just a chatbot, Speech Coach is designed to support **academic research**, **language analytics**, and **real-time dashboards**. Its modern infrastructureâ€”featuring Bytewax, ClickHouse, and FastAPIâ€”enables deep insights into language learning behavior.

### ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Iâ€™m Alexander Kim â€” a backend engineer exploring the intersection of **AI, language, and data**. I created Speech Coach to combine my passion for learning, clean architecture, and automation.
