# About Speech Coach

**Speech Coach** is a Telegram-based assistant designed to help users practice and improve their spoken English. It provides AI-powered feedback, speech recognition, and real-time progress tracking, making it ideal for TOEFL preparation, job interviews, or general conversation practice.

## Origin Story

Created by [Alexander Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aksovius), Speech Coach started as a personal project to prepare for TOEFL speaking tasks and interviews. It evolved into a robust portfolio piece, demonstrating expertise in modern backend development, real-time data pipelines, and AI integration.

## Vision

Beyond personal use, Speech Coach aims to support academic research and collaboration. Its data pipelines and analytics backend (powered by Bytewax and ClickHouse) make it a valuable tool for studying language learning patterns.
