I'm thrilled to introduce **Speech Coach**, a Telegram-based assistant designed to help users improve their spoken English. Built as a personal project to prepare for TOEFL and interviews, it’s also a showcase of modern backend and data pipeline techniques.

In this post, I’ll share the project’s vision, key features, and what’s coming next. Whether you’re a language learner, developer, or researcher, I hope Speech Coach sparks your interest!
